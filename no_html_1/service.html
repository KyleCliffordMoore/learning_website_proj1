            <h2>Eagle Scout Service Project</h2>
            <p>
                For my Eagle Scout Service Project I managed about 20 volunteers over the course of two weekends to build a bridge, 4 benches, and refurbish 
                2 rocking chairs for a local church. For this project I raised about 2 thousand dollars. The whole project including planning took about 6 months 
                from the time of proposal to completion. The Project was broken down into 4 phases, the proposal phase, the planning phase, execution phase, 
                and review phase. The project proved to be a learning oppurtunity for me as I learned a lot about not only how to manage people, but a lot about 
                how to remain organized as I had to deal with a lot of drafts, copies of reciepts, and dates. Also I had to learn to adapt as things did not 
                always go according to plan.
                <br>
                <br>Due to my Project their was now an easy way for more elderly community members to cross the small drainage gully and their were new chairs for 
                community members to sit on. The refurbished rocking chairs also made the church look more inviting.
