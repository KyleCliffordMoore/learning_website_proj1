            <h2>About Kyle Moore</h2>
            
            <p>
                I am Kyle Moore, a junoir in Computer Science and I am currently a TA for CSCE 110 as well as minoring in CyberSecurity. I would consider myself
                a team player and I do feel as if I have an edge on my fellow students in this class as I already have familiarity with backend design and PostgresSQL 
                as well as a deep understanding of Java. Over the yeas I have learned many languages with varying design philosophies ranging from C to Haskell to SQL 
                and a lot more. I feel that this has made me flexable when it comes to creating projects. That being said I am always excited to learn more and push 
                myself in this class.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently an officer in TIDAL, for this club I do a lot of outreach as well as present on AI topics and help lead Hackathons. I have also 
                participated in an Aggie Coding Club project called Tick Tock in which we made our own mock version of a messaging app. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                I view Computer Science as more than just a means to an end of making money, I have always enjoyed programming. When I was younger I used to mod 
                games and make Discord bots using Discord's and the game I was intrested in API's to pull and view stats. I believe that I am an excellent fit 
                for any corportation as I am a hard worker with big ideas. 
                I enjoy spending a lot of time with friends and also going out to the country 
                as my family has a plot of land between Love Lady and Trinity Texas. When hanging out with friends we will often play videos games 
                and when I am out in the country I spend a lot of my time dirt biking and hanging out with family friends who also has land next to 
                ours.
            </p>
