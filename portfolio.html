            <h2>Nutrinotes</h2>
            <p> 
                This project's goal was to create a website where you could create a "food catelog" in which you could put all your favorite foods into it or have a 
                catelog for "junk food", "healthy food", etc. Then Some other user could browse catelogs and decide if they like your catelog and copy it or add foods
                to make their own. The site also had a friends system so that you could friend another user and the site would show you how long the both of you had 
                been friends.

                This project involed mostly html with a small amount of javascript for the front end. The backend was made with Python using Flask and GUnicorn to 
                run the webpage which was hosted on render.com. The backend also included Postgres SQL to save and retrieve data. The github repository can be found 
                here: <br> <br>

            <h2>3D Renderer in Java</h2>
            <p> 
                This project's goal was to create a simple 3D renderer in Java usiing only Java Swing and no external libraries. The point of this project was 
                to better understand the math behind 3d renderers so I decided to see how far I could go in making my own. This project is still a work in progress 
                as I am still researching about backface culling methods to try and fix the problem where some points are out of view of the camera and others are not.

            <h2>Photo to Desmos</h2>
            <p> 
                This project's goal was to have some fun by making something that could take an image and return a set of Bézier curves that would form an image 
                that could be rendered in Desmos.
            </p>

            <p>

                This project required a lot of research into how Bézier curves worked as well as how Gaussian blurs could help in edge detection. For this project I 
                used two external libraries: OpenCV which was used to apply blurs, gray scaling, and edge detection. Potrace which was used to take bitmap images 
                and convert them into a vector image file (I used .svg). I then made a basic .svg interpreter to build the Bézier curves from the file data.

            <h2>Current Project - Flux</h2>
            <p> 
                This project's goal is just to explore AI as it has been very trendy and I want to see what all of the hype is about.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently in the automation phase as I have been able to render images by using Flux-Schnell with Comfy-UI, but now I want to take it from 
                the node based ui to the code itself.
