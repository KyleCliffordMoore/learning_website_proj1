                I have a deep passion for Computer Science, and my journey through this field has equipped me with a strong foundation in several programming languages, including Java, Python, C/C++, Haskell, JavaScript, and SQL. These languages have allowed me to approach problem-solving from different angles, leveraging the unique strengths of each language to tackle various challenges.

                My interests are particularly centered around cybersecurity and software engineering. In cybersecurity, I am fascinated by the complexity of securing digital environments and the ever-evolving nature of threats. I enjoy the challenge of developing secure code and systems that can withstand malicious attacks, ensuring that information and resources are protected.

                In software engineering, I take pride in designing and building robust software systems. The process of turning ideas into functional, efficient, and maintainable software excites me. From conceptualizing system architecture to implementing clean, efficient code, I am driven by the goal of creating software that not only meets user needs but also stands the test of time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge, particularly in these areas of interest. As technology continues to advance, I remain committed to learning and growing, seeking out opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to the field of Computer Science.

                PART 1

    1. Create me a CSS page that must contain this CSS code, have an image (set to assets/placeholder_image.png) and must have some text.
    
    2. Make me a nice looking website with a cabin feel and a text area where I will copy and paste a prompt.
    
    3. Make me some HTML for a picture and for some text with a gray square behind the text to make it stand out.
    
    4. Make me a big square on the right.
    
    5. Create me a text box with my prompts in it.
    
    6. I am interested in Computer Science, I know Java, Python, C/C++, Haskell, JavaScript, SQL. I like cybersecurity and software engineering. Create me a <p></p> talking about all of that.
    
    7. No create me a textbox, that contains what I have asked you to create, just the <p></p> please.
    
    8. No create me a textbox, that contains what I have asked you to create, just the <p></p> please.
