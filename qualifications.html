                I have developed good understanding of database management and have made multiple websites before. I also have gotten two certifications in 
                CyberSecurity, the Comptia Security+, and an A&M TEEX hosted one, Digital Forensics Basic.

                <h2>Area of Intrest</h2>
                <p>
                        I find most parts of Computer Science quite intresting and if I had to do any part I would be happy. 
                    That being said, I find that I like CyberSecurity, Software Engineering, and Databases are the most intresting. I enjoy the problem solving 
                    nature of them all. In each one you are given some problem whether that be you need something to run something in polynomial time instead of 
                    exponetial or you need to find some possible oversight and exploit it. I like the finding the solution to a problem given limited resources, 
                    nature of these fields.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I really enjoy constantly learning about evolving techniques to Computer Science problems. I like that there is always more to learn 
                    no matter how deep you get into computers.
